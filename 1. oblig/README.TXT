PROJECT TITLE: 1. obligatoriske innlevering
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
VERSION or DATE: 15.9
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
AUTHORS: Ahl Vegard Nilsen
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Create two instances of the Person class, then create an instance of the Message class. A message can now be created and sent between the persons by inserting the sender (instance of Person) and the message body to the constructor of Message. After sender and message body is passed, use the receiveMessage() on the instance of Person which is not the sender. You can toggle between offline/online status and display the status by calling the getOnlineStatus().
